### Overview
This course provides an introduction to reinforcement learning, 
which focuses on the study and design of agents that interact with a complex, 
uncertain world to achieve a goal. 
We will emphasize agents that can make near-optimal decisions in a timely manner with incomplete information and limited computational resources. 
The course will cover Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, planning, and function approximation (online supervised learning).

The course will use a recently created MOOC on Reinforcement Learning, created by the Instructors of this course. 
Much of the lecture material and assignments will come from the MOOC. 
In-class time will be largely spent on discussion and thinking about the material, with some supplementary lectures. 
The MOOC content will be covered more quickly (by mid October), 
so as to focus on research projects and reading RL papers in the second half of the course.

### Objectives
There are two primary goals for this course: 
to become an expert in the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and to complete asmall empirical research project in reinforcement learning.

By the end of the course, you will have a solid grasp of the main ideas in reinforcement learning, 
which is the primary approach to statistical decision-making. 
Any student who understands the material in this course will understand the foundations of much of modern probabilistic artificial intelligence (AI) and be prepared to take more advanced courses (in particular CMPUT 609: Reinforcement Learning II, and CMPUT 607: Theory for Reinforcement Learning), 
or to apply AI tools and ideas to real-world problems. 
That person will be able to apply these tools and ideas in novel situations 
– eg, to determine whether the methods apply to this situation, and if so, which will work most effectively. 
They will also be able to assess claims made by others, 
with respect to both software products and general frameworks, 
and also be able to appreciate some new research results.

The goal for the research project is to gain experience conducting a proper empirical study: specifying and answering a research question. 
Projects in courses have a tendency to be too big, 
and be largely incomplete by the end of the course. 
That will not be acceptable in this course. 
The goal here is to specify a small, 
feasible question that can be addressed thoroughly within the time-frame of the course. 
This means you have specified a clear question, and obtained clear evidence (thorough empirical study with controls and statistical significance).
#I will provide a list of projects. You can pick one.

Prerequisites
The course will use Python 3. We will use elementary ideas of probability, calculus, and linear algebra, such as expectations of random variables, conditional expectations, partial derivatives, vectors and matrices. Students should either be familiar with these topics or be ready to pick them up quickly as needed by consulting outside resources.

Course Topics
With a focus on AI as the design of agents learning from experience to predict and control their environment, topics will include

Markov decision processes
Planning by approximate dynamic programming
Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning for prediction
Monte Carlo, Sarsa and Q-learning for control
Dyna and planning with a learned model
Prediction and control with function approximation
Policy gradient methods
You will also learn how to read and critically assess RL papers. As a group, we will be create a document identifying errors we find in RL papers. The goal of this is to improve correctness in your own projects, and potentially also help others coming to the area avoid common mistakes.
